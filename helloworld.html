    <h1>HTML: hyper-text markup language</h1>

    <h2> Tags </h2>
    Brackets are called "tags" <br>
    There are opening and closing tags <br>
    Div tags are divisions of the websites <br>

    <h2>Header tags</h2> 
    (ie h1) take text and make it bigger
    or smaller, and bold. <br>
    There are h1-h6 header tags <br>
    You are more likely to appear higher up the google search results
    if you use keywords in h1 tags <br>

    <h2>Paragraph tag</h2>
     (p) indicates normal text. <br>
    Paragraph tags do not re-style text. <br>
    New lines need to be inputted manually. <br>
    Paragraph tags can be used to create new lines. <br>
    
    <h2> Line Break tag</h2>
    (br) tag indicates a line break. <br>
    Unlike the paragraph tag, br is a self-closing tag. <br>
    Also, the br tag does not create a space between lines, only creates a new line. <br>

    <h2> Body Tag </h2>
    The body tag (body) indicates the body of the code <br>


    <h2> Link Tag </h2>
    Link tags lead to other web pages (a href = "url"> name)
    <br>
    
    <h2> Meta Tags </h2>
    Charset tag is the character set (standard that we will use is utf-8) <br>
    Http-equiv tag= "Content-type" gives us information about the content <br>
    Viewport meta tag gives use the content width and initial scale of content <br>
    Meta tags contain information that is not visible in the browser window. <br>
    This information is behind the scenes. <br>
    Example meta-information: author, content-type, content-language, etc. <br>

    <h2> XHTML vs HTML </h2>
    <b>XHTML</b> combines HTML and XML (a markup language that requires exact documentation)
    <br>
    In xHTML, all tags must be closed. <br>
    Thus, we use br/ instead of simply br. <br>
    <h2> CSS means Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
    This works with HTMl and we will go over it in the next section. <br>
